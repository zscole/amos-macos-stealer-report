## Threat Intelligence Correlation

### VirusTotal Sandbox Analysis Summary
**Analysis Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Sample**: Streamyard.dmg (SHA256: 97cdf485b242daf345d9bf55a3cf38ce025de9eef40d26a29c829ae769d5919c)

#### Dynamic Behavior Observed
1. **Network Communications**:
   - 130+ HTTPS connections established
   - All traffic encrypted via TLS on port 443
   - Ephemeral ports in 57xxx range used
   - No cleartext C2 domains captured (encryption effective)

2. **System Interaction**:
   - Email client targeting (Mail.app extensions)
   - Messaging app access (Messages.app)
   - Power management subsystem manipulation
   - System framework enumeration

3. **Data Collection Indicators**:
   - Automated bulk collection patterns
   - Communication app preference for data theft
   - System profiling behavior

### Malware Family: Amos (macOS InfoStealer)
The uploaded DMG (`Streamyard.dmg`) was flagged across multiple vendors as part of the **Amos** macOS malware family. Amos is a well-documented **InfoStealer / Trojan-PSW** family targeting Apple systems.

### Detection Names (VirusTotal consensus)
- `Gen:Variant.MAC.Amos.9` - ALYac, BitDefender, Emsisoft, eScan, GData, VIPRE
- `Trojan-PSW.OSX.Amos` - Ikarus
- `HEUR:Trojan-PSW.OSX.Amos.ah` - Kaspersky
- `MacOS:Stealer-DK [Trj]` - Avast, AVG
- `OSX/InfoStl-ER` - Sophos
- `Mac.Siggen.472` - DrWeb
- `Trojan.Script.Agent.lazwzk` - NANO-Antivirus
- Google - generic detection

### What Amos Stealer Does
- **Steals passwords**: From Chrome, Safari, Firefox, saved logins, cookies, autofill
- **Steals crypto**: Wallet files, browser extensions with wallet data
- **Collects system info**: Hostname, OS version, hardware IDs, usernames
- **Sends data out**: Uses HTTP or Telegram bots to send stolen data
- **Stays persistent**: Installs LaunchAgents so it runs on reboot
- **Common delivery**: Fake software, cracked apps, phishing sites

### How This Attack Fits
- Fake StreamYard installer is typical Amos behavior (pretending to be real software)
- Drag-into-Terminal trick is unusual but fits their social engineering style
- Multi-stage loader matches known Amos techniques
- All antivirus vendors confirm this is password-stealing malware

### What Would Have Happened
If this had run successfully:
- Steal all browser passwords and cookies
- Grab crypto wallets and extensions
- Install itself to run every time you reboot
- Send everything to criminals via encrypted channels

### Why This Matters
- Amos is an active threat to Mac users
- Companies should add these IOCs to their security tools
- The YARA rules can catch similar attacks

**Bottom Line**:  
This fake StreamYard app is part of the larger Amos malware campaign. Multiple antivirus engines confirmed it's malicious. This shows why we need good defenses against credential theft.
